For this game we need to use the arrow key (up, down, left, right) for navigation. The green one is the snake and the red dot is the food for the snake. You need to nevigate your snake and collect all the food. You can not hit the boarder line or your own (snake) body. If does so your game will be over. The more you can collect the food the snake will going to get bigger and you will earn more points and the game will be going to be harder once it gets bigger and you achieve more points.

Our highest score so far was 201. Enjoy the game. Thanks
